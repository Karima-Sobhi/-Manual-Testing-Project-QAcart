# ðŸ§ª Manual Testing Project â€“ QAcart Bootcamp 2022

This repository contains my complete end-to-end **manual testing project**, completed as part of the **Manual Testing Bootcamp 2022** by [QAcart](https://qacart.com), led by **Hatem Hatamleh**.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary

As part of the course, I worked on an **end-to-end testing project** writing all testcases, executing them and writing bug reports.

The application under test (AUT) is a simple yet functional **ToDo web application** that allows users to:
- Add and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- View the current list of tasks
- Register and log in to manage personal tasks

This project focused on testing the core functionality and user experience of the application.
